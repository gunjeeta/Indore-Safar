    <br><br>
    <p>Built in the year 1766 by the rulers of the Holkar Dynasty, the grand Rajwada Palace is one of the top places to
        visit
        in Indore. This seven-storied palace, which exhibits a mix of Maratha, French, and Mughal architectural styles,
        is a
        fine example of royal splendor. The entrance of the palace features a grand archway and a huge wooden gate
        complete with
        iron studs. The main building comprises a courtyard, ornate balconies and windows, jharokas, elaborately carved
        wooden
        jalis, corridors, and galleried rooms.

        An interesting feature of Rajwada Palace is that its top floors are made of wood while the lower three floors
        are carved
        out of stone. The palace is now a property maintained by the State Archeology Department which also runs a small
        souvenir shop within the building. The light and sound show held here in the evenings is a major attraction for
        visitors.</p>
    <p>
        <br>
        <strong>Trivia:</strong> The palace has been damaged by fire and rebuilt not just once or twice, but three times
        in the last 250 years.

        <p>Another one of the prominent historical places in Indore is the Lal Bagh Palace, a grand building which once served as
        the residence of the Holkar rulers. Built in 1886-1921 by Maharaja Shivaji Rao, this beautiful three-storied edifice is
        located on the banks of Khan River. The building features a grand entrance, a garden of roses, regal artwork by Indian
        and Italian artists, and an exquisite ballroom. The ornate décor and interiors of Lal Bagh Palace, complete with
        beautiful wall carvings, chandeliers, rich carpets, and marble floors, will leave you awestruck.
        
        Today, the palace is converted into a museum where you can see an interesting range of artifacts. Needless to say, a
        visit to this magnificent palace which spreads over 28 acres is one of the best things do in Indore
        .</p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <strong>Trivia:</strong> The main gates of Lal Bagh Palace are modeled just like the gates of Buckingham Palace in London.

        <p>The Central Museum, also known as Indore Museum, is where you can travel back in time and learn a thing or two about the
        region’s rich past. But that’s not all. The building also serves as one of the major historical places in Indore.
        
        The museum was established during the colonial period, back in 1929, and features a fine collection of prehistoric
        objects, relics, coins, Parmar scriptures, medieval and pre-medieval Jain and Hindu scriptures, arms and armors, and
        others. A must-visit place for history buffs, it is one of the best museums in Indore.

        <p>Another important historical place to visit in Indore is the Krishna Pura Chhatris, which comprises of three chhatris or
        cenotaphs. These structures house the remains of the deceased members of the Holkar Dynasty and hence are also called
        the Holkar Chaatris. Built in the 19th century over the place where these rulers were cremated, the place is named after
        Krishna Bhai Holkar, who was the wife of the famous military leader Yashwantrao Holkar.
        
        Located on the banks of the River Khan or Kahn, these chhatris are a made of stones and also feature statues of
        soldiers, elaborate carvings of gods and goddesses on the exteriors, and a Krishna temple built for Maharani Krishna
        Bhai. Krishna Pura Chhatris are located a short walk away from Rajwada Palace, so you can cover both these monuments in
        one go.
