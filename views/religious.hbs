        <p>Khajrana Ganesha Temple is one of the most visited temples in the city because of its history and religious
            beliefs
            attached to it. The locals especially have a lot of faith in the temple and the blessings that they get from
            here; which
            in a way makes it a priority in any travellerâ€™s list. It is believed that the temple was originally built by
            Ahilya Bai
            Holkar and was later subjected to some finishing touches by different historic personalities. According to
            several
            religious beliefs, it is said that whoever comes here and wishes for something, the wish gets fulfilled
            within a short
            span of time. That is the reason that you might see people praying at Khajrana Ganesha Temple for getting a
            baby or some
            work related problems. To add to the religious aura of the place, there is also a dargah nearby. This is
            dedicated to
            Nahar Sayed who is believed to be buried headless here. For Muslims, this place holds great religious
            importance and is
            frequented by a dozen of people every day.</p>

        <p>Gomatgiri, a small hillock near Indore, is one of the most popular religious attractions for the followers of
            Jainism.
            Located only a 10 minutes drive away from the airport in the city, the hillock is synonymously known for its
            nearly 21
            feet statue of Gomateshwar. The statue is said to be an exact replica of the Bahubali statue of
            Shrawanbegola. Also,
            what makes Gomatgiri interesting is the presence of 24 marble temples, beauty of which is accentuated by
            their shikhars.
            Each one of these beautiful temples is dedicated to the one of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jain religion.
            Interestingly, the
            hillock was donated to the Jain Samaj by the M.P government in the year 1981.
